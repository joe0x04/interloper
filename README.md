This is my latest attempt at writing a content management system for the Quake 2 community. It's aim is to replace the current KMLeague software that run http://q2scene.com. This CMS was wonderful at the time, but it's very dated now, missing features, not mobile-friendly and is generally miserable to use.

## The idea:
Players can join the site and either create or join existing **communities**. A community could be based around a particular MOD or gameplay mode (duel, capture the flag, rock paper scissor), it could be geographic based (a Polish scene, a Canadian scene), maybe development based (mod writing, mapping, demo editing) or any combination therein. 

Communities can then have their own features like:

 - Tournaments
 - Ladders
 - Teams/Clans
 - Discussion forums
 - File Repositories (code, configs, screenshots, demos, etc)
 
 The goal is to have each community be as self-governing as possible
